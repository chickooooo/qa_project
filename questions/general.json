  "what is machine learning?": "machine learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data",
  "why should we use machine learning?": "because machine learning can find patterns in data that normal human can't",
  "name some applications of machine learning": "image classification, chatbots, data prediction & forecasting, product recommendation, bot in games",
  "what are different types of machine learning systems?": "[supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, reinforcement learning]\n[online learning, batch learning]\n[instance based learning, model based learning]",
  "what is supervised learning?": "in supervised learning the data contains the features as well as labels",
  "name 2 tasks that supervised learning algorithm performs": "regression and classification",
  "name some supervised learning algorithms": "linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, k nearest neighbor",
  "what is unsupervised learning?": "in unsupervised learning the training data is unlabeled and the model tries to find pattern in the data without any human interference",
  "name some tasks that unsupervised learning algorithm performs": "clustering, anomaly & novelty detection, dimensionality reduction, association",
  "name some unsupervised learning algorithms": "clustering: [k-means, k-nearest neighbor, DBSCAN, hierarchical]\nanomaly detection: [one class SVM, isolation forest]\ndimensionality reduction: [PCA]\nassociation: [apriori]",
  "what is semisupervised learning?": "many unlabled instances and few labeled instances. it combines supervised and unsupervised algorithms. e.g. identifying clusters",
  "what is reinforcement learning?": "the algorithm learns based on reward-penalty system",
  "what is batch learning?": "also called as offline learning. the algorithm is trained at once using all the available data. for new data you need to train the system from scratch again",
  "what is online learning?": "also called as incemental learning. the algorithm is trained using mini-batches of data. the algorithm can adapt to rapid changing data",
  "what is out-of-core learning?": "using online learning to train algorithm on huge dataset that cannot fit in memory",
  "what is learning rate in online learning?": "it defines how fast the algorithm should adapt to changing data",
  "what is instance based learning?": "the system learns the example by heart, then predicts the new case by using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned examples",
  "what is model based lerning?": "it involves building a model from training data and then using the model to make predictions",
  "name some challenges of machine learning": "insufficient quantity of training data\nnon-representative training data\npoor quality of data\nirrelevant features\noverfitting the training data\nunderfitting the training data",
  "what is model regularisation?": "constraining the model to make it simpler and avoid the risk of overfitting",
  "what is hyperparameter?": "a hyperparameter is the parameter of the learning algorithm",
  "what is hyperparameter tunning?": "it refers to finding a set of best parameter values for the learning algorithm, so that the algorithm is able to generalise well",
  "what do you mean by overfitting?": "when the model performs well on training data but fails to perform on test data",
  "what are the reasons for overfitting?": "small size of dataset\nmore complex model than required\ntraining model too long on same data\npresence of irrelevant features(noice)",
  "how do you overcome overfitting?": "selecting simpler model\nmodel regularisation\ngathering more data\nreducing noice in the data",
  "what do you mean by underfitting?": "when the model cannot perform well on both training and test data",
  "what are the reasons for underfitting?": "too simple model\nnot enough data\nnoice in data",
  "how do you overcome underfitting?": "selecting more powerful model with more parameters\ngathering more data\nproper feature selection\nreducing noice",
  "what is training set, test set and validation set?": "training set is the part of dataset on which you train your algorithm, test set is the remaining part of dataset on which you test your algorithm. validation set is the part of training set that acts as test set during algorithm training.",
  "what do you mean by cross-validation?": "the model is trained multiple times on subsets of the training set and evaluated using validation set",
  "what is a pipeline?": "a sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline",
  "what is a performance matrix?": "also known as evaluation matrix. it is used evaluate the performance and quality of the model",
  "what is an utility function?": "also called as fitness function. it measure how good the model is. higher the value, better is the model. e.g. R squared",
  "what is a cost function?": "it is opposite of utility function. it measures how bad the model is. higher the value, worse is the model. e.g MSE"
